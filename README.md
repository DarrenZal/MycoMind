# MycoMind

A Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system that performs LLM-driven, ontology-based knowledge extraction into Obsidian vaults. MycoMind transforms unstructured information into structured, interconnected knowledge graphs using user-defined schemas.

## 🌟 Features

- **Ontology-Driven Extraction**: Uses JSON-LD schemas to define knowledge structures
- **Dual Processing Modes**: 
  - **Standard Mode**: Creates new structured notes for extracted entities
  - **File-as-Entity Mode**: Updates original files with rich YAML frontmatter while preserving content
- **Obsidian Integration**: Creates structured Markdown notes with YAML frontmatter and WikiLinks
- **LLM-Powered Processing**: Leverages language models for intelligent information extraction with retry logic
- **Semantic Linking**: Automatically creates `[[WikiLinks]]` for entity relationships
- **Robust Validation**: Schema-based validation with proper handling of empty relationships
- **Configurable Workflows**: Easy-to-customize ETL pipelines with caching and quality filtering
- **Self-Documenting**: The project uses its own principles to maintain its documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (or compatible LLM service)
- Obsidian vault (optional, for viewing results)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MycoMind.git
cd MycoMind
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your settings:
```bash
cp examples/config_example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your API keys and paths
```

### Basic Usage

1. Define your knowledge schema in the `schemas/` directory
2. Configure your data sources in `config.json`
3. Run the ETL pipeline:

```bash
python scripts/main_etl.py --config config.json --schema schemas/your_schema.json
```

## 📖 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/docs` folder:

- **[Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)**: System design and component overview
- **[Ontology Design](docs/Ontology_Design.md)**: How to create effective schemas
- **[ETL Process](docs/ETL_Process.md)**: Understanding the data pipeline
- **[Configuration](docs/Configuration.md)**: Detailed setup instructions
- **[Semantic Linking](docs/Semantic_Linking.md)**: Entity relationship strategies

## 🔬 Advanced Documentation: The Project Knowledge Graph

MycoMind practices what it preaches by maintaining its own documentation and codebase as a queryable knowledge graph. This advanced feature allows power users to perform deep, semantic queries about the project itself.

**What is it?**
- A Neo4j-compatible knowledge graph containing the project's architecture, code structure, and documentation
- Enables complex queries like "Show me all functions that implement schema parsing" or "Find documentation sections related to Obsidian integration"

**Benefits:**
- Deeply queryable documentation beyond simple text search
- Understand complex relationships between code, features, and documentation
- Explore the project's architecture through graph traversal
- See practical examples of the system's own output

**Getting Started:**
This is an optional feature for advanced users. See **[Querying the Project's Knowledge Graph](docs/Querying_Project_KG.md)** for detailed setup instructions and example queries.
